description: "Organize the task backlog"
---

Reorganize TODO section for efficient execution:
1. Group related tasks together
2. Priority order: [STABILITY] > quick wins > features > nice-to-haves
3. Add grouping comments if helpful

Commit and push: `git add -A && git reset .claude/settings.local.json 2>/dev/null; git commit -m "Plan: Reorganize task backlog" && git push`

Do NOT implement - only organize.

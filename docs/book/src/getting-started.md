# Getting Started

Welcome to Nethercore ZX game development! This section will guide you through everything you need to start creating games.

## Quick Start Path

1. **[Prerequisites](./getting-started/prerequisites.md)** - Set up Rust and the WASM target
2. **[Your First Game](./getting-started/first-game.md)** - Build a simple interactive demo
3. **[Understanding the Game Loop](./getting-started/game-loop.md)** - Learn `init()`, `update()`, `render()`

## Ready for More?

After completing the Getting Started guides, continue with:

- **[Build Paddle](./tutorials/paddle/index.md)** - A complete game tutorial from scratch
- **[API Reference](./cheat-sheet.md)** - All available functions
- **[Example Games](https://github.com/nethercore/nethercore/tree/main/examples)** - 28+ examples to learn from

## Minimum Requirements

- Rust (via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
- WASM target: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`

That's it! No external game engines, no SDKs to download. Just Rust.

# Ember Data Pack Manifest
#
# This file tells `ember pack` which assets to bundle into the ROM data pack.
# Assets loaded via rom_* FFI functions bypass WASM memory entirely.
#
# Build workflow:
#   1. ember build          # Compile Rust to WASM
#   2. ember pack           # Bundle assets into data pack
#   3. ember run            # Launch in emulator

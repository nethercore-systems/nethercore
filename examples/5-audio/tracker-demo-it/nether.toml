# - Converts them to 22050 Hz mono i16 format
# - Creates sound IDs from instrument names
# - Deduplicates identical samples across files
#
# Available songs:
#   - "Nether Dawn" (Orchestral, 90 BPM, D major): strings, brass, choir, timpani, flute
#   - "Nether Acid" (Acid Techno, 130 BPM, E minor): TB-303 bass, 909 drums, resonant filter

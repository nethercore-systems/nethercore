# GLB Inline Example - Raw GLB References with Multiple Animations
#
# This example demonstrates referencing raw .glb files directly in nether.toml.
# The build system auto-converts GLB to native formats at pack time.
#
# Key features demonstrated:
# - Direct .glb file paths (no pre-conversion needed)
# - skin_name selector for skeleton extraction
# - animation_name selector for extracting specific animations from one file
# - Loading multiple animations from the SAME GLB file
#
# Build:
#   cargo xtask build-examples   # Runs gen-glb-inline-assets, then nether build/pack
#   nether run                   # Launch the example

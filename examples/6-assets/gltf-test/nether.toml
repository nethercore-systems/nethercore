# Nether Data Pack Manifest - GLTF Pipeline Test
#
# Demonstrates the full GLTF/GLB asset pipeline:
# - Textured skinned mesh with UV coordinates
# - Skeleton with inverse bind matrices
# - Keyframe animation
#
# Build workflow:
#   1. cargo run -p gen-gltf-test-assets   # Generate assets from GLB
#   2. nether build                         # Compile Rust to WASM
#   3. nether pack                          # Bundle assets into data pack
#   4. nether run                           # Launch in emulator

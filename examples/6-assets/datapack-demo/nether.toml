# Nether Data Pack Manifest
#
# This file tells `nether pack` which assets to bundle into the ROM data pack.
# Assets loaded via rom_* FFI functions bypass WASM memory entirely.
#
# Build workflow:
#   1. nether build          # Compile Rust to WASM
#   2. nether pack           # Bundle assets into data pack
#   3. nether run            # Launch in emulator

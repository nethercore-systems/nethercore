# GLB Rigid Example - Multiple Meshes with Imported Animation
#
# This example demonstrates rigid transform animation using multiple
# mesh pieces loaded from separate GLB files. Unlike skinned animation,
# rigid animation applies transforms to entire meshes (no bone deformation).
#
# Key features demonstrated:
# - Multiple .glb files for separate mesh pieces
# - Animation imported from GLB via keyframe_read() (not procedural!)
# - Rigid animation (no skeleton_bind, but uses skeleton for keyframe access)
#
# The meshes are:
# - Base: rotating platform
# - Arm: extending segment
# - Claw: opening/closing gripper
#
# Key difference from skinned animation:
# - Skinned: skeleton_bind() + keyframe_bind() + one deformable mesh
# - Rigid: keyframe_read() + push_translate/push_rotate + multiple meshes
#
# Build:
#   cargo xtask build-examples   # Runs gen-glb-rigid-assets, then nether build/pack
#   nether run                   # Launch the example

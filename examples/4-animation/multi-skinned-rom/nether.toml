# Nether Data Pack Manifest - Multi-Skinned ROM Example
#
# Demonstrates ROM-backed skeletal animation with inverse bind matrices.
# Assets are generated by: cargo run -p gen-multi-skinned-assets
#
# Build workflow:
#   1. cargo run -p gen-multi-skinned-assets  # Generate assets
#   2. nether build                            # Compile Rust to WASM
#   3. nether pack                             # Bundle assets into data pack
#   4. nether run                              # Launch in emulator

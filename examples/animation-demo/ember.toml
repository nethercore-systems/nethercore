# Animation Demo - Keyframe Animation System Test (Animation System v2)
#
# Demonstrates the ROM-backed keyframe animation system:
# - Loading keyframes from data pack via rom_keyframes()
# - Step-based animation with keyframe_bind() - uses static GPU buffers
# - Blended animation with keyframe_read() + set_bones_4x4() - uses immediate bones
#
# Animation System v2 optimizations:
# - All keyframe data uploaded to GPU once during init
# - Zero per-frame CPU decoding in stamp mode
# - Immediate bones buffer supports multiple bone states per frame
#
# Build workflow:
#   1. cargo xtask build-examples  # Builds all examples including this one

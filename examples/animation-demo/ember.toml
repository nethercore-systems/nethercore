#
# Demonstrates the ROM-backed keyframe animation system:
# - Loading keyframes from data pack via rom_keyframes()
# - Step-based animation with keyframe_bind() (stamp mode)
# - Blended animation with keyframe_read() + set_bones_4x4()
#
# Build workflow:
#   1. cargo xtask build-examples  # Builds all examples including this one
